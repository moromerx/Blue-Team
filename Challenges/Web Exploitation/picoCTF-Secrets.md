The task states, "We have several pages hidden. Can you find the one with the flag?" So we have to find the hidden page which contains the flag.

Access the "Inspect" tool by right-clicking. If we go to the sources, we can see the files under the assets directory. Notice that the assets directory is under a "secret" directory.

**Web Directories:**

Think of a web server like a file cabinet, with folders (directories) and files in it. Each folder can have more folders and files inside. 
In web terminology, we access these folders through URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). When you go to website.com/secret/, you're asking the server to show you the contents of the secret folder. 

**Accessing a Directory via URL:** 

If you type picoctf.net/secret/ into your browser: If directory listing is on and there's no index file (like index.html), the server will show you a list of files in the secret folder. 
If directory listing is off but there is an index file, the server will serve that file, and youâ€™ll see a webpage. 

Let's visit the secret directory and see what the web server will return. Go to ".../secret/". 

`Note:`

>**Trailing Slash (.../secret/):**
>
>The trailing slash indicates that secret is a directory. When you include the trailing slash, the server looks for the default document within that directory, >such as index.html, index.php, etc. 
>If there is a default document set up to respond when the directory is accessed, the server will serve that file, and you will see a web page. 
>
>**Without Trailing Slash (.../secret):**
>
>If you omit the trailing slash, the server treats secret as a file. Since there is no file by that name, the server might return a forbidden page because itâ€™s >trying to prevent directory 
>listing without explicit requests, or it might not have a file named secret to display.

It returns the page with a "you almost found me" message. Great! We are on the right track! 

Further inspection reveals a "hidden" directory:

Proceeding to ".../secret/hidden/" leads to a page with another directory named "superhidden":

Finally, accessing the "superhidden" page reveals the flag:
