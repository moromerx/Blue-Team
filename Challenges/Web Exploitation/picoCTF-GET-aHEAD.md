**Burp Suite & Proxy**

A proxy acts as a middleman between your computer and the internet.Â 
When you use a proxy, your internet requests are sent to the proxy server first and then forwarded to the intended website.Â 
Similarly, responses come back to the proxy server before being sent back to your computer.

Burp Suite is a tool that helps you test the security of web applications. 
It works as a proxy, which means it lets you see and modify the messages sent between your browser and the web servers.

To intercept the traffic, click on the 'intercept off' button to turn it on.

If you now reload the website, the page gets stuck and you now see the request on Burp Suite. You now have the option to modify and forward the request.

Under the repeater tab, you have the option to send requests and see the response the web server returns.
If we go back to our challenge description, we can see the title is "GET aHEAD".

GET and HEAD are both request methods in HTTP primarily used to get data from a server.
The difference between the two lies in the response they receive from the server.

**GET Request**

Purpose: The GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. When you click on a link or type a URL into your browser,Â 
Your browser is most likely sending a GET request to the server asking for the web page or data located at that URL.

Response: The server responds with the content you requested, which could be a webpage, an image, or a videoâ€”basically, the full content of the resource.

**HEAD Request**

Purpose: The HEAD request is similar to the GET request in that it asks for a resource.Â 
However, it's used when you only want to retrieve the metadata about the resource, not the resource itself.

Response: The server responds only with headers, which include information like the size of the resource,Â 
the type of content it is, and when it was last modified. No actual content (body of the resource) is sent back.

Right now the web request is using the "GET" method to retrieve data; we can modify it to the "HEAD" method and click forward.

We can see the response with our flag.

Done!ðŸŽ‰
