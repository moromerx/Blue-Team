## Hello
Open up your MITRE Navigator and choose the enterprise Matrix to create your Threat Group heatmap on. First click on Create New Layer, then click on Enterprise.
For this exercise, we are going to choose the Threat Group APT 29. You can find the Groups' description on the attack.mitre.org website under the tab groups. You can choose any other group if so please.
Use your search and multi select tool icon to search for APT29 on the Navigator. You will notice that one technique with one Threat Group. 
Open up the down arrow on the Threat Group tab to reveal APT29. Click on the select button in order to set all the techniques that APT29 use on the Navigator.
After you have chosen the APT29 selection, you will notice a border highlight around each technique relevant to the Group. I have highlighted one of the techniques in blue by hovering my mouse over it, to show that block as one of the techniques.

Other techniques are highlighted with a bold border around them.
To make the techniques visible and to heat map them, we need to attach a score to the techniques. A score is a numeric value assigned to a technique. The meaning or interpretation of scores is completely up to the user. You can click on the scoring icon and add a score of one.

By default, techniques are "unscored" meaning that no score has been assigned to the technique.

The technique blocks are now highlighted in a red colour. You can add any score value depending on your outcome. For example, you can add a grading score or a score based on the red team using these techniques.
Adding a score is useful when you want to compare layers and add up the techniques used by different groups. Hovering your mouse over a technique will reveal that the score has been added successfully.
Under your layer information icon, enter the Group name, so it has relevance and titles your layer. We are adding APT29 and giving it a description. Points 1 and 2.
